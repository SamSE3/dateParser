#Introduction
General description.        
Mission statement: To write a program that emulates the game ‘2048’ as a means of introducing and getting to know sub versioning, unit testing and integration testing as part of Software Engineering 3.

Schedule (iterative every lab/work session).       
|Half|what|
|--------------|--------------|
|1st|start writing code|
|2nd|write test cases (as unit tests)|
Note: It is recognised that it should be reversed, that is, write tests before code.

#Required resources
Hardware       
|What		|why|
|--------------|--------------|
|		|no specific hardware is required|

Software          
|What		|why|
|--------------|--------------|
|Github 		|for version control|
|C compiler	|to compile the source code|

Testing tools         
|What		|why|
|--------------|--------------|
|-		|no testing tools|

Staff      
|What		|why|
|--------------|--------------|
|me		|to do all the coding and testing|

#Testable aspects
Unit testing aspects
* Tilting a row left
 * Tilting a row right
 * Tilting a column up
 * Tilting a column down
* Tilting the board left
 * Tilting the board right
 * Tilting the board up
 * Tilting the board down
* Random insertion of a number into the game
* Flipping the board left
 * Flipping the board right
* Create an empty board

Integration testing aspects
* Test tilting left then tilting right

#Non Testable aspects
* Any graphical user interface that uses these methods

#Test Produced documents
* The specifics of each test
* Demonstration that all of the test pass

#Risks and dependencies
* That the staff do not have the ability to write the program for lack of programming knowledge
* That there will not be enough time to complete the project given other staff commitments

#Project Criteria
Goals  
The aim is that all possible types of input are tested and that the program passes these tests
Success and Failure measured by  
Success will be measured based on the amount of tests that pass combined with their relevance to the core functionality of the program
